# Filament Compilation

This is a **compilation of filament profiles** I have used for 3D printing. The profiles have been exported directly from **UltiMaker Cura** and can be re-imported by following these steps:

***Preferences > Materials > Import > Select the profile of that filament***

# Specifications
In all cases I have tried to find the recommended values for each filament directly on the manufacturer's website. If there are any errors let me know.
